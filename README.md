ARTH Collateral Models
======================

This package contains scripts to simulate $ARTH's vault algorithim across various market conditions.

The goal of this modeling is to figure out what are the ideal parameters we should use for our vault.

This can be things like; Collaterals, Collateriazation Ratio, Stop losses, etc..
